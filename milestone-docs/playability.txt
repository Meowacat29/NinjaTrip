Basics:
- Polygonal geometry with the Blade Trap mesh
- Extend progressive, non-repetitive play time to 4+ minutes
- Non-trivial physics with player movement (momentum) and rope swinging (angular momentum)
- Load level from .txt files
- Include help tab for controls
- Improved collision detection

Creative:
- More complex sprite animation for the player's movements
- Background added with particle effect
- 5 levels with varying difficulty
